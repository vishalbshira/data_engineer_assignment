Title: Implement Logging with Datadog for API and Database Operations

Integrate Datadog for logging API requests, responses, and database operations for observability and tracking performance.

- Configure Datadog agents on API servers and database instances to collect logs.
- Modify API code to generate structured logs compatible with Datadog (e.g., JSON format).
- Include relevant metadata such as request method, endpoint, status codes, response times, and customer IDs in the logs.
- Create Datadog dashboards to visualize API and database logs, focusing on key metrics such as request latency, error rates, and query performance.
- Set up Datadog notifications to send alerts via email, Slack, or other communication channels.

Definition of Done:
- Datadog integration is complete, with logs from API and database operations successfully forwarded to Datadog.
- Structured logging is implemented, including relevant metadata and formatting.
- Datadog dashboards are set up to visualize key metrics and logs effectively.
- Alerts and notifications are configured and tested for critical log events.
